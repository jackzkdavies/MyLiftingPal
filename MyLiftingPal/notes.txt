so you have the day where u add exercises to

and u can just use that if u want

so just search for an exercise and add it

or

you can create your own exercises

that get added to the global database

u prob wont do that since most will already be there

and then you can also make workouts

that contain exercises

and then when you go to add and exercise

instead you can add a workout

and it preadds all the exercise you specified in that workout

and i reckon workout templates that users create should be global too

so then other users can search for like

"big booty blaster"

and add it if they dont know what to do to target their booty

ok and then on top of that

you can also create programs that contain workouts

so say you have a weekly schedule

then you can add a program started from a given date

and it will pre add all the workouts
